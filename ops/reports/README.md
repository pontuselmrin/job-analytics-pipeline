# Reports

This folder contains non-core operational outputs used during stabilization and QA.

- `enrichment/`: matrix/audit outputs from enrichment checks.
- `batches/`: per-batch review artifacts (`.md` + `.json`).

These artifacts are intentionally isolated from core scraper/enrichment source code.
